# ReminderApp
 This is beta-version of this app and also this is my first experience of Mvvm architecture 
 
 I'm working on it and I will add some features for sure
 
 Here what I use to create this app

 - Mvvm architecture 
 - Live data
 - Room database
 - AlarmManager for scheduling time
 - notification
 - broadcast receiver
 - some ui elements like RecyclerView,... 
 - DatePicker and TimePicker
